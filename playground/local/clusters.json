      "{{Manchester United manager does not know if club will back him • Mourinho describes Liverpool as ‘lucky ones’ and praises Salah}}. José Mourinho has made the surprise admission that he does not know if Manchester United will back him in the January transfer window. United arrive at Liverpool for Sunday’s game having taken only six points from their past five Premier League matches and the manager is eager to add to his squad but says he is unsure whether the Old Trafford hierarchy will invest in recruits.“I don’t know if we are going to have new players – I would like to – but I don’t know if it is possible or not. It depends on the club,” he said, adding that his immediate aim is winning matches.“Honestly, I’m focused on my job of playing Liverpool and next week playing Cardiff, and I’m more focused on that.”Mourinho said Liverpool have been lucky this season, though did admit his successful teams also benefited from a measure of good fortune.“They are very confident about themselves,” Mourinho said.“They are top of the league, they have this feeling of – I know that feeling well – the feeling of the ‘lucky ones’ where everything goes in your direction.“They know how they beat Everton [a late Divock Origi strike], they know that the last match, the opening goal was offside [in the 4-0 win over Bournemouth ], and they know that against Napoli in the last seconds they could be out [referring to Alisson’s save]. They have this feeling, that I also had when my teams were top of the league, that it looks like everything goes in your direction.”He does, however, believe Liverpool will respect United.“I think they are obviously very confident,” he said.“But I think they are not stupid. I think they know the match they have is difficult. They also know that we have our weaknesses, our strengths, and I think they will respect our strengths.“If they don’t do that, I will be happy with that. But they know that the game is very difficult for them. They know that they need every point if they want to be champions so I think they are professionals and being professionals is respecting Manchester United. They know that we can go there and win.”Mourinho described Mo Salah’s threat to his team as “nuclear”.“Every match we try to analyse opponents, the strengths and the weaknesses, and when you go to Liverpool they have many strengths, but of course he is nuclear in the strength,” he said of the last season’s top scorer, who has 13 goals in 23 appearance this time round.“So do we have to speak and think about him? I think we have to think about him. Of course we have to think about him and think of the best way to cope with a fantastic player like he is.”Mourinho managed Salah when at Chelsea and believes he has now matured.“I remember I played him at White Hart Lane and at the Etihad and it was too much for him. Now he plays everywhere against any team – he can go to Barcelona, can go to Madrid and he plays like: ‘I am Mo-Mo-Salah and I am afraid of no one and nobody.",

It depends on the club,” he said, adding that his immediate aim is winning matches. “Honestly, I’m focused on my job of playing Liverpool and next week playing Cardiff, and I’m more focused on that.”\n\nMourinho said Liverpool have been lucky this season, though did admit his successful teams also benefited from a measure of good fortune. “They are very confident about themselves,” Mourinho said. “They are top of the league, they have this feeling of – I know that feeling well – the feeling of the ‘lucky ones’ where everything goes in your direction.\n\n“They know how they beat Everton [a late Divock Origi strike], they know that the last match, the opening goal was offside [in the 4-0 win over Bournemouth ], and they know that against Napoli in the last seconds they could be out [referring to Alisson’s save]. They have this feeling, that I also had when my teams were top of the league, that it looks like everything goes in your direction.”\n\nHe does, however, believe Liverpool will respect United. “I think they are obviously very confident,” he said. “But I think they are not stupid. I think they know the match they have is difficult. They also know that we have our weaknesses, our strengths, and I think they will respect our strengths.\n\n“If they don’t do that, I will be happy with that. But they know that the game is very difficult for them. They know that they need every point if they want to be champions so I think they are professionals and being professionals is respecting Manchester United. They know that we can go there and win.”\n\nMourinho described Mo Salah’s threat to his team as “nuclear”. “Every match we try to analyse opponents, the strengths and the weaknesses, and when you go to Liverpool they have many strengths, but of course he is nuclear in the strength,” he said of the last season’s top scorer, who has 13 goals in 23 appearance this time round. “So do we have to speak and think about him? I think we have to think about him. Of course we have to think about him and think of the best way to cope with a fantastic player like he is.”\n\nMourinho managed Salah when at Chelsea and believes he has now matured. “I remember I played him at White Hart Lane and at the Etihad and it was too much for him. Now he plays everywhere against any team – he can go to Barcelona, can go to Madrid and he plays like: ‘I am Mo-Mo-Salah and I am afraid of no one and nobody.’”",

The World Cup Golden Boot winner leaned in for a quick chat and the adoring youngster seemed to hang on his every word.... Whatever was said seemed to work a treat as the penalty was buried in the bottom left corner, though the mascot wasn't the most mobile of stoppers. Kane shared the short clip on his Instagram page with his 7.4million followers. The predominantly right-footed forward added the caption: 'A better left foot than me! Great taking pens with the youngsters at the Junior Xmas party.'Having developed through the Spurs academy, Kane knows what it takes to make it through the ranks to first team football at the club. He is chasing the Premier League Golden Boot this year and has currently netted nine times. The 25-year-old is level with Raheem Sterling and trails Mo Salah and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who are one goal in front. Kane will be looking to make the difference when Spurs take on fierce London rivals Arsenal in their League Cup quarter-final on Wednesday night."

      "\"We are still in the Champions League because of him,\" says Reds defender. Andy Robertson insists that Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker has nothing to apologise for despite a rare error handing Manchester United an undeserved equaliser at Anfield on Sunday. And the Reds defender pointed out that Liverpool are \"still in the Champions League because of him.\"AfterSadio Manehad fired the Reds ahead against United, the visitors were gifted an equaliser when aBecker blunder was punished by Jesse Lingard. Aldo: important to get clean sheet in first leg against Munich. But Robertson rapped: \"He has been unbelievable this season and we all make mistakes.\"It is just if Mo Salah or (Roberto) Firmino make a mistake it maybe doesn’t get punished because it is up the other end, but that is unfortunately what a keeper has to put up with. If they make a mistake it usually turns into a goal.\"Of course he will be disappointed with it but he bounced back and we can’t moan about it. He has dug us out, we are still in the Champions League because of him.\"We have not dug him out of a hole but we have put in a performance and his error hasn’t been highlighted because we have won the game and that is what a good squad does.\"Must-read Liverpool FC stories from the past 24 hours"

Dejan Lovren has mocked Mohamed Salah on Instagram as Liverpool’s favourite bromance continues to flourish, much to the delight of Reds fans. The duo’s tight bond was once again showcased afterJurgen Klopp’s side’s 3-1 victory over Manchester United on Sunday as the Croatian posted a superb picture of himself withSalahfromLiverpool’s Christmas partyon his own Instagram account. And the other side of their friendship was on show on the social media platform the following day after the Egyptian uploaded a picture on his own profile, with his six pack the focus of the image,causing a stiramongst supporters yet again. A number of Salah’s team-mates from past and present, including former AS Roma colleague Kevin Strootman and compatriot Ahmed Elmohamady wasted no time in commenting. But it wasLovren’s reply that gained the most laughs as he commented: “2.7% fat. Now u can breath (sic) out”.With crying laughter emojis aplenty on show in response, one user commented: “You two are the funniest duo”, while another added “I need a friend like you bro!”Meanwhile, one use posted “When can you catch up with him? After 20 months?”, referencing Lovren’s previous admiration andhilarious responseto Salah’s physique. It is not the first time the defender has lightly teased his team-mate on Instagram, aftermocking his fashion senseearlier this month. The duo’s ongoing bromance has been one of the off-field highlights at Anfield since Salah joined the club, with Lovrenopening upon his friendship last month, saying: \"From day one, we felt this connection.\"We have been talking a lot, we were talking about private things and we have a similar background, a tough life from the beginning. Salah finds Lovren's dance moves hilarious. \"It wasn't easy to grow up where he was in Egypt without anything, and I had a similar thing in Croatia with the war and going back to Germany.\"And then with his normality, how he can talk to you and when you see how he thinks... we are good friends, coffee, jokes!\"The one-minute interview which highlights how FEARED Liverpool are across Europe.

      "CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SPECIAL ON THE ROUND OF 16 GERMANS WILL FIND IT TOUGH SUNSPORT'S LotharEUROPEAN EXPERT Matthaus. FOR a few years I have been very confident about German teams when they play against English sides in Europe. But after the last-16 draw, I must admit it could be very tough for my country. To have three ties between English and German clubs is fantastic. Two will be very close and come. You have so many battles. Jurgen Klopp against Niko Kovac, Manuel Neuer in one goal, Alisson in the other, a team that is growing against one that is maybe down to fine details. The other looks a question of the margin of victory. Liverpool against Bayern is the tie of the round, a special game.going the other way. And up front Mo Salah so front, Salah, determined to make up for what happened in last season's final loss to Real Madrid, and Robert Lewandowski (right). Liverpool have performed far better this season. They are a team of high quality who came so close last season and know what they have to do. They have players off the bench who can make the difference as well. We saw that on Sunday when Xherdan Shaqiri netted twice to win the game against Manchester United. Klopp has done an amazing job and his big signings for this year — Alisson, Virgil van Dijk and Naby Keita — have added quality and stability. Liverpool are a team that can win the biggest titles. They are talented and motivated and with the personality of their coach. Bayern will be better after the winter break than they have been so far. They should get their injured players back. But men like Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels and Neuer are not what they were. For me, Liverpool are the clear favourites. There could not be more difference between Manchester City and Schalke. The experience of the coach, the quality of the players, the style of the football. Schalke have struggled this season, getting a point a game. City are on a different level. It is hard to see how Schalke can possibly win over two legs. Spurs and Borussia Dortmund met in the group stage last year, when Tottenham were far better. But Dortmund now have the leaders they didn't have then, a better goalkeeper, stability, and in Lucien Favre a coach who knows what he wants to do and has built on what he did with Moenchengladbach and others. I've real respect for Mauricio Pochettino and Spurs. He doesn't need to pay £50million, £60m, £70m for a player — he takes players and builds them and that is an incredible job. They have so many top playersmany of them English too.players, too. Spurs have improved mentally from last season, when they were better than Juventus but lost because they had two or three bad minutes over the whole tie. I think Dortmund will get through, just, but only because I am German. But the one German I am confident will have success is Thomas Tuchel. Paris Saint-Germain are more focused and disciplined than in the past two or three years. That is down to boss Tuchel. He has altered the way PSG approach matches and prepared them for the Champions League. Jose Mourinho knows how to prepare for these games. He provokes the refereesthe other team referees, team, the media — all the tricks. But Manchester United's boss is not happy with what he has seen, especially from Paul Pogba and Alexis Sanchez. Can he change that? Maybe he just doesn't like working with superstars. Tuchel has put more character into PSG and connected with his players. The team now comes first. Neymar and Kylian Mbappe are special talents, too. They believe they can make their dream come true.

      "CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SPECIAL ON THE ROUND OF 16. GERMANS WILL FIND IT TOUGH. Lothar Matthaus SUNSPORT'S EUROPEAN EXPERT. FOR a few years I have been very confident about German teams when they play against English sides in Europe. But after the last-16 draw, I must admit it could be very tough for my country. To have three ties between English and German clubs is fantastic. Two will be very close and come down to fine details. The other looks a question of the margin of victory. Liverpool against Bayern is the tie of the round, a special game. You have so many battles. Jurgen Klopp against Niko Kovac, Manuel Neuer in one goal, Alisson in the other, a team that is growing against one that is maybe going the other way. And up front Mo Salah so front, Salah, determined to make up for what happened in last season's final loss to Real Madrid, and Robert Lewandowski. Liverpool have performed far better this season. They are a team of high quality who came so close last season and know what they have to do. They have players off the bench who can make the difference as well. We saw that on Sunday when Xherdan Shaqiri netted twice to win the game against Manchester United.

        "text": "CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SPECIAL ON THE ROUND OF 16 GERMANS WILL FIND IT TOUGH SUNSPORT'S LotharEUROPEAN EXPERT Matthaus\n\nFOR a few years I have been very confident about German teams when they play against English sides in Europe.\n\nBut after the last-16 draw, I must admit it could be very tough for my country.\n\nTo have three ties between English and German clubs is fantastic.\n\nTwo will be very close and come\n\nYou have so many battles.\n\nJurgen Klopp against Niko Kovac, Manuel Neuer in one goal, Alisson in the other, a team that is growing against one that is maybe down to fine details. The other looks a question of the margin of victory.\n\nLiverpool against Bayern is the tie of the round, a special game.\n\ngoing the other way.\n\nAnd up front Mo Salah so front, Salah, determined to make up for what happened in last season's final loss to Real Madrid, and Robert Lewandowski (right).\n\nLiverpool have performed far better this season. They are a team of high quality who came so close last season and know what they have to do.\n\nThey have players off the bench who can make the difference as well. We saw that on Sunday when Xherdan Shaqiri netted twice to win the game against Manchester United.\n\nKlopp has done an amazing job and his big signings for this year — Alisson, Virgil van Dijk and Naby Keita — have added quality and stability.\n\nLiverpool are a team that can win the biggest titles. They are talented and motivated and with the personality of their coach.\n\nBayern will be better after the winter break than they have been so far. They should get their injured players back.\n\nBut men like Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels and Neuer are not what they were. For me, Liverpool are the clear favourites. There could not be more difference between Manchester City and Schalke.\n\nThe experience of the coach, the quality of the players, the style of the football.\n\nSchalke have struggled this season, getting a point a game. City are on a different level.\n\nIt is hard to see how Schalke can possibly win over two legs. Spurs and Borussia Dortmund met in the group stage last year, when Tottenham were far better.\n\nBut Dortmund now have the leaders they didn't have then, a better goalkeeper, stability, and in Lucien Favre a coach who knows what he wants to do and has built on what he did with Moenchengladbach and others.\n\nI've real respect for Mauricio Pochettino and Spurs. He doesn't need to pay £50million, £60m, £70m for a player — he takes players and builds them and that is an incredible job.\n\nThey have so many top playersmany of them English too. players, too. Spurs have improved mentally from last season, when they were better than Juventus but lost because they had two or three bad minutes over the whole tie.\n\nI think Dortmund will get through, just, but only because I am German.\n\nBut the one German I am confident will have success is Thomas Tuchel.\n\nParis Saint-Germain are more focused and disciplined than in the past two or three years.\n\nThat is down to boss Tuchel.\n\nHe has altered the way PSG approach matches and prepared them for the Champions League.\n\nJose Mourinho knows how to prepare for these games. He provokes the refereesthe other team referees, team, the media — all the tricks.\n\nBut Manchester United's boss is not happy with what he has seen, especially from Paul Pogba and Alexis Sanchez.\n\nCan he change that? Maybe he just doesn't like working with superstars.\n\nTuchel has put more character into PSG and connected with his players. The team now comes first.\n\nNeymar and Kylian Mbappe are special talents, too. They believe they can make their dream come true.\n\nTweet @LMatthaeus10 facebook.com/lotharmatthaeus FC SCHALKE v MAN CITY First leg Wednesday, February 20. Second leg Tuesday, March 12 MANAGER: Domenico Tedesco GROUND: Veltins Arena (54,740) CAPTAIN: Ralf Fahrmann STAR MAN: Nabil Bentaleb FIVE straight defeats to start the Bundesliga season — and only four wins so far — mean Schalke are peering over their shoulders at the drop zone.\n\nBENTALEB The lack of goals has been the biggest problem with ex-Spurs midfielder Bentaleb the unlikely top scorer with six. But the Germans qualified comfortably behind Porto in a weak Champions League group.\n\nPREVIOUS MEETINGS CUP WINNERS CUP (1969-70) Schalke 1-0 Man City Man City 5-1 Schalke UEFA CUP (2008-09): Schalke 0-2 Man City LM VERDICT: This is less of a contest than a mismatch. There is surely only one winner and it will be easy for them.\n\nWINNERS: MANCHESTER CITY MANAGER: Thomas Tuchel GROUND: Parc des Princes (47,929) CAPTAIN: Thiago Silva STAR MAN: Neymar PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN are running away with Ligue 1, still unbeaten after a ridiculous 16 games — and ten points clear with two games in hand.\n\nSILVA But after infamous chokes against Barcelona and Real Madrid in recent seasons, beating Liverpool in the crunch fifth group game last month gave the French champions the belief they are ready to take the next step.\n\nUnited will need to hope they get nervous here, too.\n\nPREVIOUS MEETINGS (The two sides have never met in a competitive match) LM VERDICT: You can never discount a Jose Mourinho side but I'm not sure United have the quality to cope with Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani.\n\nWINNERS: PSG MAN UNITED v PSG First leg Tuesday, February 12. Second leg Wednesday, March SPURS v B DORTMUND leg Wednesday, February 13. Second leg Tuesday, March 5 LIVERPOOL v B MUNICH First leg Tuesday, February 19. Second leg Wednesday, March 16 MANAGER: Niko Kovac GROUND: Allianz Arena (70,000) CAPTAIN: Manuel Neuer STAR MAN: Robert Lewandowski THE Munich hierarchy took aim at German media as they backed under-fire boss Kovac.\n\nBut the cracks are not far under the surface as Dortmund are already nine points clear.\n\nThe crisis that hit Germany after the World Cup debacle has engulfed Bayern Munich too.\n\nPREVIOUS MEETINGS FAIRS CUP (1970-71) Liverpool 3-0 B Munich B Munich 1-1 Liverpool CUP WINNERS' CUP (1971-72) Liverpool 0-0 B Munich B Munich 3-1 Liverpool EUROPEAN CUP (1980-81) Liverpool 0-0 B Munich B Munich 1-1 Liverpool UEFA SUPER CUP (2001) B Munich 2-3 Liverpool LM VERDICT: Bayern will be improved by then but Liverpool have the quality to go through.\n\nNEUER WINNERS: LIVERPOOL MANAGER: Lucien Favre GROUND: Signal Iduna Park (65,829) CAPTAIN: Marco Reus STAR MAN: Paco Alcacer STILL unbeaten in the Bundesliga and nine points clear at the top, Favre's reputation has grown as he moulds a bright young team.\n\nSANCHO England kid Jadon Sancho, 18, has been a revelation but just as critical have been Mario Gotze and skipper Reus. Alcacer is scoring for fun since his move from Barca to replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.\n\nPREVIOUS MEETINGS EUROPA LEAGUE (2015-16) Dortmund 3-0 Tottenham Tottenham 1-2 Dortmund CHAMPIONS LEAGUE (2017-18) Tottenham 3-1 Dortmund Dortmund 1-2 Tottenham LM VERDICT: Dortmund are different from last year, when Spurs won twice. It will be tight but I'll back the Germans — as I'm German.\n\nWINNERS: DORTMUND A MADRID v JUVENTUS First leg Tuesday, February 12. Second leg Wednesday, March 6 LM VERDICT: Cristiano Ronaldo and Mario Mandzukic can make home advantage count in the second leg. WINNERS: JUVENTUS LYON v BARCELONA First leg Tuesday, February 19. Second leg Wednesday, March 16 LM VERDICT: The French side are solid but can't match Barca. There is only one possible result here. WINNERS: BARCELONA ROMA v PORTO First leg Tuesday, February 12. Second leg Wednesday, March 6 LM VERDICT: The worst runnersup against the worst winners.

        "text": "CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SPECIAL ON THE ROUND OF 16\n\nGERMANS WILL FIND IT TOUGH\n\nLothar Matthaus SUNSPORT'S EUROPEAN EXPERT\n\nFOR a few years I have been very confident about German teams when they play against English sides in Europe.\n\nBut after the last-16 draw, I must admit it could be very tough for my country.\n\nTo have three ties between English and German clubs is fantastic.\n\nTwo will be very close and come down to fine details. The other looks a question of the margin of victory.\n\nLiverpool against Bayern is the tie of the round, a special game.\n\nYou have so many battles.\n\nJurgen Klopp against Niko Kovac, Manuel Neuer in one goal, Alisson in the other, a team that is growing against one that is maybe going the other way.\n\nAnd up front Mo Salah so front, Salah, determined to make up for what happened in last season's final loss to Real Madrid, and Robert Lewandowski.\n\nLiverpool have performed far better this season. They are a team of high quality who came so close last season and know what they have to do.\n\nThey have players off the bench who can make the difference as well. We saw that on Sunday when Xherdan Shaqiri netted twice to win the game against Manchester United.\n\nKlopp has done an amazing job and his big signings for this year — Alisson, Virgil van Dijk and Naby Keita — have added quality and stability.\n\nLiverpool are a team that can win the biggest titles. They are talented and motivated and with the personality of their coach.\n\nBayern will be better after the winter break than they have been so far. They should get their injured players back.\n\nBut men like Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels and Neuer are not what they were. For me, Liverpool are the clear favourites. There could not be more difference between Manchester City and Schalke.\n\nThe experience of the coach, the quality of the players, the style of the football.\n\nSchalke have struggled this season, getting a point a game. City are on a different level.\n\nIt is hard to see how Schalke can possibly win over two legs. Spurs and Borussia Dortmund met in the group stage last year, when Tottenham were far better.\n\nBut Dortmund now have the leaders they didn't have then, a better goalkeeper, stability, and in Lucien Favre a coach who knows what he wants to do and has built on what he did with Moenchengladbach and others.\n\nI've real respect for Mauricio Pochettino and Spurs. He doesn't need to pay £50million, £60m, £70m for a player — he takes players and builds them and that is an incredible job.\n\nThey have so many top playersers many of them English too. players, too. Spurs have improved mentally from last season, when they were better than Juventus but lost because they had two or three bad minutes over the whole tie.\n\nI think Dortmund will get through, just, but only because I am German.\n\nBut the one German I am confident will have success is Thomas Tuchel.\n\nParis Saint-Germain are more focused and disciplined than in the past two or three years.\n\nThat is down to boss Tuchel.\n\nHe has altered the way PSG approach matches and prepared them for the Champions League.\n\nJose Mourinho knows how to prepare for these games. He provokes the refereesthe other team referees, team, the media — all the tricks.\n\nBut Manchester United's boss is not happy with what he has seen, especially from Paul Pogba and Alexis Sanchez.\n\nCan he change that? Maybe he just doesn't like working with superstars.\n\nTuchel has put more character into PSG and connected with his players. The team now comes first.\n\nNeymar and Kylian Mbappe are special talents, too. They believe they can make their dream come true.\n\nTweet @LMatthaeus10 facebook.com/lotharmatthaeus\n\nFC SCHALKE v MAN CITY\n\nFirst leg Wednesday, February 20. Second leg Tuesday, March 12\n\nMANAGER: Domenico Tedesco\n\nGROUND: Veltins Arena (54,740)\n\nCAPTAIN: Ralf Fahrmann\n\nSTAR MAN: Nabil Bentaleb FIVE straight defeats to start the Bundesliga season — and only four wins so far — mean Schalke are peering over their shoulders at the drop zone.\n\nBENTALEB The lack of goals has been the biggest problem with ex-Spurs midfielder Bentaleb the unlikely top scorer with six.

      "Liverpool meet FC Bayern to crown three German-English duels in Champions League eighth-finals. Simon Pausch. The defeat still haunts him today, he says. Never again has Jürgen Klopp watched the Champions League final of 2013, Dortmund's 1:2 against FC Bayern was \"simply too bitter \".Six years later, the 51-year-old, who is now working as FC Liverpool coach, has a chance of revenge. In the royal class's round of sixteen, the Reds will face FC Bayern (19 February and 13 March). It's a duel that electrified Anfield Road months before the first leg. It is the highlight of the German-English weeks in the premier class, completed by the duels between Borussia Dortmund and Tottenham and FC Schalke with Manchester City.\"Liverpool are the team of the hour, leaders of the standings in England, they play really good football, very physical, they really put their foot down,\" said Bayern Sports Director Hasan Salihamidzic, who was secretly hoping for an easier draw: \"You have to have two good days. This is a team that's really top of the line. A chunk, but you look forward to it as a player. \"In their current condition, however, Mo Salah, Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino give their opponents little pleasure. Their latest victim were the eternal rivals of Manchester United, who had no chance at the 1-3 draw on Sunday. The Liverpool offensive machine fired 36 shots on goal, Mané and former Bayern professional Xherdan Shaqiri (2) scored.\"Our initial phase was one of the best we've shown since I've been here,\" Klopp raved after the game, which put his team back at the top of the standings: \"The first half hour was extraordinary.\"The attacking power Liverpool brought to the final against Real Madrid last year will be joined this season by an enormously strong defence. The Klopp side have scored just seven goals in the league, by far the best result in the Premier League. Virgil van Dijk, the organiser of the first leg against FC Bayern, will be missing because of a yellow bar. Nevertheless, for the first time in years, the Munich side will be outsiders in a duel of the last sixteen in the Champions League. Klopp spoke of a \"beautiful lot, I am happy to return to Germany. But we don't think: luckily Bavaria. And they won't think: luckily Liverpool. Since working in England, Klopp has played against FC Bayern in the Munich arena. Liverpool clearly won the preparatory game in summer 2017 3:0.The more important duel, however, is a long time ago. Almost six years after his defeat in the final with BVB, Klopp finally wants to defeat his trauma. The next round of the Europa League was also drawn by lot. The remaining two German teams caught unpleasant opponents. Leverkusen will face FK Krasnodar in the round of the last 32 teams, Frankfurt will have to play Schachtjor Donezk. The games will take place on 14 and 21 February. All duels in the round of sixteen of the king's class at a glance. Jürgen Klopp, FC Liverpool"

        "text": "Liverpool meet FC Bayern to crown three German-English duels in Champions League eighth-finals\n\nSimon Pausch\n\nThe defeat still haunts him today, he says. Never again has Jürgen Klopp watched the Champions League final of 2013, Dortmund's 1:2 against FC Bayern was \"simply too bitter \". Six years later, the 51-year-old, who is now working as FC Liverpool coach, has a chance of revenge. In the royal class's round of sixteen, the Reds will face FC Bayern (19 February and 13 March).\n\nIt's a duel that electrified Anfield Road months before the first leg. It is the highlight of the German-English weeks in the premier class, completed by the duels between Borussia Dortmund and Tottenham and FC Schalke with Manchester City. \"Liverpool are the team of the hour, leaders of the standings in England, they play really good football, very physical, they really put their foot down,\" said Bayern Sports Director Hasan Salihamidzic, who was secretly hoping for an easier draw: \"You have to have two good days. This is a team that's really top of the line. A chunk, but you look forward to it as a player. \"\n\nIn their current condition, however, Mo Salah, Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino give their opponents little pleasure. Their latest victim were the eternal rivals of Manchester United, who had no chance at the 1-3 draw on Sunday. The Liverpool offensive machine fired 36 shots on goal, Mané and former Bayern professional Xherdan Shaqiri (2) scored. \"Our initial phase was one of the best we've shown since I've been here,\" Klopp raved after the game, which put his team back at the top of the standings: \"The first half hour was extraordinary.\"\n\nThe attacking power Liverpool brought to the final against Real Madrid last year will be joined this season by an enormously strong defence. The Klopp side have scored just seven goals in the league, by far the best result in the Premier League. Virgil van Dijk, the organiser of the first leg against FC Bayern, will be missing because of a yellow bar. Nevertheless, for the first time in years, the Munich side will be outsiders in a duel of the last sixteen in the Champions League.\n\nKlopp spoke of a \"beautiful lot, I am happy to return to Germany. But we don't think: luckily Bavaria. And they won't think: luckily Liverpool. Since working in England, Klopp has played against FC Bayern in the Munich arena. Liverpool clearly won the preparatory game in summer 2017 3:0.\n\nThe more important duel, however, is a long time ago. Almost six years after his defeat in the final with BVB, Klopp finally wants to defeat his trauma.\n\nThe next round of the Europa League was also drawn by lot. The remaining two German teams caught unpleasant opponents. Leverkusen will face FK Krasnodar in the round of the last 32 teams, Frankfurt will have to play Schachtjor Donezk. The games will take place on 14 and 21 February.\n\nAll duels in the round of sixteen of the king's class at a glance\n\nJürgen Klopp, FC Liverpool ",

      "full-back robertson highlights strength in depth of reds' squad as title mission continues. LIVERPOOL full-back Andy Robertson believes the club have got the strength in depth required to maintain their thrilling pursuit of a first title for 29 years. The Scotland left-back admits that confidence is sky-high after Sunday's 3-1 victory over Manchester United put the Reds a point clear of the Premier League's defending champions Manchester City. Jurgen Klopp's unbeaten side are enjoying the best start to a top-flight season in the club's history having dropped just six points so far this term with a trio of draws. The Reds will guarantee top spot for Christmas if they win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Friday night and then they face home games with Newcastle United and Arsenal before the titanic clash with City at The Etihad Stadium on January 3.\"We are in December, we know how tough this period is but we are top of the league,\" Robertson said.\"We have just got to keep going. We know how good Man City are, we have a bit of a gap that has opened up now to third. The two of us are close to each other but we believe we can stay top.\"There is a long way to go and we still have to play big games, starting on Friday night and we hopefully move on from there.\"It has been a huge few weeks. People maybe looked at the fixtures and thought 'Everton, it's a derby, always tough, Bournemouth, always tough, Napoli was a must-win and Man United speaks for itself.'\"We have come out unscathed but we can't just rest on that and take our eye off the ball.\"We need to stay focused 100% and look forward to the challenge at Wolves who have done well this season. We'll rest and get ready for another big one.\"The depth of Klopp's squad was underlined by the contribution of match-winner Xherdan Shaqiri off the bench against the Red Devils. The Swiss attacker struck twice to ensure that momentum was maintained, while Nathaniel Clyne and Fabinho both caught the eye on their return to the starting line-up.\"You look at the bench and there is probably a few people disappointed not to start - and rightly so,\" Robertson said.\"We have all got positions to fight for and that is the beauty of having a good squad.\"Shaq comes on and shows everyone what he can do and scores the two goals and he will take the headlines.\"Hendo (Jordan Henderson) came on and shored up the midfield, won every tackle, and never lost a header against (Marouane) Fellaini, which is always tough.\"These guys were disappointed not to play before kick-off but they come on and make such a difference for us.\"It was a real all-round performance.\"Robertson has flourished at Anfield since being snapped up from relegated Hull City. Shaqiri also made the move to Liverpool at a bargain fee after enduring similar heartache with Stoke City.\"He is seizing his chance and good on him, you can use it to your advantage because you might go under the radar a wee bit,\" Robertson said.\"There might not be as big a deal made about your signing but you can use that to your advantage because it takes time to get your feet under the table.\"Shaq has hit the ground running, quicker than I did, so credit to him.\"He has learned the way to play and he has been fantastic all season - a real threat for us and his stats this season are very good, so long may that continue.\"Robertson has been in outstanding form so far this season and his all-action performance against United even earned rave reviews from Jose Mourinho. The United boss said he was \"tired just looking at Robertson\" who he described as \"absolutely incredible\".Typically, the modest full-back was keen to deflect the praise on to others.\"It is just part and parcel of my game, I will keep on going until the end,\" he added.\"I got a bit of space, particularly second half and the gaffer is always banging on to me and Trent (Alexander-Arnold), more so this season, that we have to be more involved and I just tried to do that.\"Special mention goes to Clyney, being out for so long and my God, he did brilliantly. He has had his struggles with injury but he put in a first-class performance and that just sums up our squad at the minute.\"It was a very controlled performance by all of us. We just had a blip five minutes before half-time but other than that we controlled the game and deserved the win.\"We struggled against United last season.\"They beat us comfortably at Old Trafford and I think it was 0-0 here so they have been a bit of a bogey team.\"To put in a performance like that and get the result we needed is massive for us. It only takes us three points closer to where we want to go but hopefully it is a big step for us.\"After Sadio Mane had fired the Reds ahead, United were gifted an equaliser when Alisson Becker's blunder was punished by Jesse Lingard. But Robertson insists the Brazil No.1 had nothing to apologise for given his heroics in recent weeks.\"He has been unbelievable this season and we all make mistakes,\" Robertson said.\"It is just if Mo Salah or (Roberto) Firmino make a mistake it maybe doesn't get punished because it is up the other end, but that is unfortunately what a keeper has to put up with.\"If they make a mistake it usually turns into a goal.\"Of course he will be disappointed with it but he bounced back and we can't moan about it. He has dug us out, we are still in the Champions League because of him.\"We have not dug him out of a hole but we have put in a performance and his error hasn't been highlighted because we have won the game and that is what a good squad does.\""

        "text": "full-back robertson highlights strength in depth of reds' squad as title mission continues\n\nLIVERPOOL full-back Andy Robertson believes the club have got the strength in depth required to maintain their thrilling pursuit of a first title for 29 years.\n\nThe Scotland left-back admits that confidence is sky-high after Sunday's 3-1 victory over Manchester United put the Reds a point clear of the Premier League's defending champions Manchester City.\n\nJurgen Klopp's unbeaten side are enjoying the best start to a top-flight season in the club's history having dropped just six points so far this term with a trio of draws.\n\nThe Reds will guarantee top spot for Christmas if they win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Friday night and then they face home games with Newcastle United and Arsenal before the titanic clash with City at The Etihad Stadium on January 3. \"We are in December, we know how tough this period is but we are top of the league,\" Robertson said.\n\n\"We have just got to keep going. We know how good Man City are, we have a bit of a gap that has opened up now to third. The two of us are close to each other but we believe we can stay top.\n\n\"There is a long way to go and we still have to play big games, starting on Friday night and we hopefully move on from there.\n\n\"It has been a huge few weeks. People maybe looked at the fixtures and thought 'Everton, it's a derby, always tough, Bournemouth, always tough, Napoli was a must-win and Man United speaks for itself.' .\n\n\"We have come out unscathed but we can't just rest on that and take our eye off the ball.\n\n\"We need to stay focused 100% and look forward to the challenge at Wolves who have done well this season. We'll rest and get ready for another big one.\"\n\nThe depth of Klopp's squad was underlined by the contribution of match-winner Xherdan Shaqiri off the bench against the Red Devils.\n\nThe Swiss attacker struck twice to ensure that momentum was maintained, while Nathaniel Clyne and Fabinho both caught the eye on their return to the starting line-up.\n\n\"You look at the bench and there is probably a few people disappointed not to start - and rightly so,\" Robertson said.\n\n\"We have all got positions to fight for and that is the beauty of having a good squad.\n\n\"Shaq comes on and shows everyone what he can do and scores the two goals and he will take the headlines.\n\n\"Hendo (Jordan Henderson) came on and shored up the midfield, won every tackle, and never lost a header against (Marouane) Fellaini, which is always tough.\n\n\"These guys were disappointed not to play before kick-off but they come on and make such a difference for us.\n\n\"It was a real all-round performance.\"\n\nRobertson has flourished at Anfield since being snapped up from relegated Hull City. Shaqiri also made the move to Liverpool at a bargain fee after enduring similar heartache with Stoke City.\n\n\"He is seizing his chance and good on him, you can use it to your advantage because you might go under the radar a wee bit,\" Robertson said.\n\n\"There might not be as big a deal made about your signing but you can use that to your advantage because it takes time to get your feet under the table.\n\n\"Shaq has hit the ground running, quicker than I did, so credit to him.\n\n\"He has learned the way to play and he has been fantastic all season - a real threat for us and his stats this season are very good, so long may that continue.\"\n\nRobertson has been in outstanding form so far this season and his all-action performance against United even earned rave reviews from Jose Mourinho.\n\nThe United boss said he was \"tired just looking at Robertson\" who he described as \"absolutely incredible\".\n\nTypically, the modest full-back was keen to deflect the praise on to others.\n\n\"It is just part and parcel of my game, I will keep on going until the end,\" he added.\n\n\"I got a bit of space, particularly second half and the gaffer is always banging on to me and Trent (Alexander-Arnold), more so this season, that we have to be more involved and I just tried to do that.\n\n\"Special mention goes to Clyney, being out for so long and my God, he did brilliantly. He has had his struggles with injury but he put in a first-class performance and that just sums up our squad at the minute.\n\n\"It was a very controlled performance by all of us. We just had a blip five minutes before half-time but other than that we controlled the game and deserved the win.\n\n\"We struggled against United last season.\n\n\"They beat us comfortably at Old Trafford and I think it was 0-0 here so they have been a bit of a bogey team.\n\n\"To put in a performance like that and get the result we needed is massive for us. It only takes us three points closer to where we want to go but hopefully it is a big step for us.\"\n\nAfter Sadio Mane had fired the Reds ahead, United were gifted an equaliser when Alisson Becker's blunder was punished by Jesse Lingard.\n\nBut Robertson insists the Brazil No.1 had nothing to apologise for given his heroics in recent weeks.\n\n\"He has been unbelievable this season and we all make mistakes,\" Robertson said.\n\n\"It is just if Mo Salah or (Roberto) Firmino make a mistake it maybe doesn't get punished because it is up the other end, but that is unfortunately what a keeper has to put up with.\n\n\"If they make a mistake it usually turns into a goal.\n\n\"Of course he will be disappointed with it but he bounced back and we can't moan about it.

After a relatively slow start to the season with his only Dream Team highlight a 22 points haul against Macclesfield Town in Game Week 6, Snodgrass has made for lost time in recent Game Weeks. The versatile midfielder has racked up more points in the past three Game Weeks than any other player and is slowly making a surprise assent up the overall points-scoring charts with 72 points.
